      content="Aspiring Abroad is a platform connecting students planning to study abroad with volunteers experienced in immigration and studying abroad. Get informed about real-world experiences and make well-informed decisions about your international education plans. Our chat system allows you to connect with volunteers who have relevant experiences in your target country or region. You can freely ask questions, and volunteers will provide answers based on their first-hand knowledge. This is a free service aimed at helping students and prospective immigrants by addressing their doubts and questions. The platform allows you to specify the country and even narrow it down to the city you are interested in connecting with people from, ensuring you receive relevant insights. Brief profiles of available chat partners are provided, allowing you to decide whom you would like to initiate a chat with. Our platform offers one-on-one conversations for personalized and focused discussions, but you can engage with multiple volunteers concurrently. Your privacy is protected, with only your name and profile photo visible to chat partners. Chat histories are saved for 180 days, and you can update your profile information and preferences anytime."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
